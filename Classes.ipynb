    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Class provides a feature of bundling the data and functionality together. To access the data and function inside a class, an instance of a class (object) is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    class ClassName:\n",
    "        <statement-1>\n",
    "        ..\n",
    "        ..\n",
    "        <statement-n>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    class SimpleClass:\n",
    "        a = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "        def func(self):\n",
    "            return 'Simple Function'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An attribute reference in a class is normally a variables and functions defined inside the class. To access those attributes, ```ClassName.<variable>``` or ```ClassName.<function>```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SimpleClass.a         # 10\n",
    "SimpleClass.func      # <function __main__.SimpleClass.func(self)>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Class instantiation uses function notation like structure just by pretending the class name ```ClassName()```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    x = ClassName()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiation process creates a empty object of a class which means there is no state (*state* means value assigned to the variables of an class object). Many developers would like to create a class instance by passing the state at the time of creation of instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special function is available in python ```__init__()```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.data = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*self* is a compulsory argument of an ```__init__``` function which allows us to set a value to variables of a class object. To access a object variables inside a ```__init__()```, *self.<variable_name>*\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass a value to ```__init__()```, please check the code below and understand\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    class SimpleClass:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "            self.a = value\n",
    "            \n",
    "    x = SimpleClass(30)\n",
    "    print(x.a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class and Instance Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variable are unique to each instance and Class variable are shared commonly by all instances of the class\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    class HouseInsect:\n",
    "            behaviour = 'Insect'         # class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "            def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "                self.name = name         # instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    fly = HouseInsect('Fly')\n",
    "    print(fly.name)\n",
    "    print(fly.behaviour)\n",
    "    print(HouseInsect.behaviour)\n",
    "    mosquito = HouseInsect('Mosquito')\n",
    "    print(mosquito.name)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. To check instance type, use ```isinstance()```\n",
    "2. To check class inheritance, use ```issubclass()```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*\n",
    "```\n",
    "    # isinstance() snippet\n",
    "    a = 10\n",

    "#### Private Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",
    "        a = 10\n",
    "        _b = 20\n",
    "\n",

    "    print(MyClass._b)        # 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute above code snippet, you will get an output as 10, 20, 10, 20 (each prints in newline). But as per the definition, we cannot access the private variable without an object. Here we access it using ClassName.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does it looks weird?**\n",
    "     -- The correct answer is that there is no concept of private member variable in python\n",
    "     \n",
    "There is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called *name mangling*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    class Mapping:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, iterable):\n",
    "            print(\"__init__\")\n",
    "            self.items_list = []\n",
    "            self.__update(iterable)\n",
    "\n",
    "        def update(self, iterable):\n",
    "            print(\"Super Update\")\n",
    "            for item in iterable:\n",
    "                self.items_list.append(item)\n",

    "                self.items_list.append(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example would work even if MappingSubclass were to introduce a ```__update identifier since it is replaced with _Mapping__update in the Mapping class and _MappingSubclass__update in the MappingSubclass class``` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; it still is possible to access or modify a variable that is considered private. This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger."
